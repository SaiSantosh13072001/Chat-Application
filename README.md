Install the Node.js module to the project to use the "WebSocket" server for the real-time communication and data streaming in web applications.

I was working on the chat application frontend logic that includes all the features that are user interaction, real-time communication with the "WebSocket" server & also dynamic updatesto the user interface.

Created a "script.js" file to handle the WebSocket Connection, Event Listeners, WebSocket Message Handling, Helper Functions, Edge Case Handling & Real-Time Updates in the application.

Also created a "server.js" file have to implement the  backend logic in the chat application to handle the WebSocket connections, managing Message Handling, User Authentication, Room Management, Message Broadcasting, Disconnection Handling & Helper Functions.
